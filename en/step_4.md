## Check the Result

Now let's add the code to see who won. 



+ You need to compare the `player` and `computer` variables to see who won. 

  If they're the same then it's a draw:

+ Test your code by playing the game a few times until you get a draw. 

  You'll need to click `Run` to start a new game. 

+ Now let's look at the cases where the player chose 'r' (rock) but the computer didn't. 

  If the computer chose 's' (scissors) then the player wins (rock beats scissors). 
  
  If the computer chose 'p' (paper) then the computer wins (paper beats rock).
  
  We can check the player choice *and* the computer choice using `and`.

+ Next let's look at the cases where the player chose 'p' (paper) but the computer didn't:

+ And finally, can you add the code to check for the winner when the player chose 's' (scissors) and the computer chose rock or paper?

+ Now play the game to test your code.
