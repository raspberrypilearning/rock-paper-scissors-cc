## Introduction

In this project you will make a Rock, Paper, Scissors game and play against the computer.  

Rules: You and the computer both choose rock, paper or scissors. The winner is decided by these rules:

+ Rock blunts scissors
+ Paper covers rock
+ Scissors cut paper

## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to make a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors using variables and conditional statements. 

## Online Resources

__This project uses Python 3.__ We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

+ [‘Rock, Paper, Scissors’ Resources -- jumpto.cc/rps-go](http://jumpto.cc/rps-go)

There is also a trinket containing the completed project:

+ [‘Rock, Paper, Scissors’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/e1e1d873be](https://trinket.io/python/e1e1d873be)

## Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ rock-paper-scissors/rock-paper-scissors.py

You can also find a completed version of this project in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ rock-paper-scissors-finished/rock-paper-scissors.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives
+ Variables;
+ Selection (`if`, `elif`, `else`); 
+ Boolean `==` and `and`.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges
+ "ASCII art" - Use conditional logic to display ASCII art for rock, paper and scissors. 
+ "Create a new game" - Duplicate the Rock, Paper, Scissors game and remix it to create a new game.
